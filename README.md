# MeowBotWorking
A working version of a discord MeowBot for DoliaCats.
You will need your own token (a special key for your bot) from discord developer's page and prefix (a symbol for writing bot commands).
Create separate .js file 'botData' and write your token and key there as constants and then export them. For example: (export const token = 'Your token'; export const prefix = 'any symbol like !'). Or just add these constatns into your bot.js file.

Using MeowBot

First, type npm install. Then type "node bot.js" into your console to start this bot.
